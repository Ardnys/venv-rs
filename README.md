# venv-rs

venv-rs is a high level Python virtual environment manager specifically developed for my personal workflow and needs.

My python virtual environments easily get out of hand, especially when I work on AI projects. I get confused and end up with 5 pytorch installations taking half of my disk space. It's difficult to manage manually with terminal and file explorer. Thus, this weird thing has been developed!

Basically this will show me an overview of my virtual environments so I can keep them tidy.
